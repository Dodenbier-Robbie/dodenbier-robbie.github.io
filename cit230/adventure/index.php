            <p>Known as <strong>"The River of No Return"</strong>, Idahoâ€™s Wild and Scenic Salmon River cuts through the heart of the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, the largest wilderness in the lower 48 states. The most massive river in Idaho and one of the largest in North America, the Salmon wends its way through the second deepest canyon on the continent. It passes through 85 miles of remote wilderness, and is a world-renown river adventure, offering one a unique chance to disconnect from civilization and become immersed in a virtually untouched natural wonder.</p>
